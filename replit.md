## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The website follows a traditional multi-page static website architecture built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each major section of the site is implemented as a separate HTML file (index.html, services.html, pricing.html, about.html, contact.html) with shared styling and navigation components.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Static Site Approach**: Chosen for simplicity, fast loading times, and easy deployment without server-side dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to create mobile-friendly layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Component-Based CSS**: Styles are organized with reusable classes and CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- **Icon Integration**: Font Awesome 6.0 CDN provides professional iconography throughout the interface

### Styling System

The CSS architecture uses a modern approach with:
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Color palette and design tokens are centralized using CSS variables for maintainability
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Layouts adapt from mobile to desktop using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Component-Based Classes**: Reusable CSS classes for buttons, cards, navigation, and layout components
- **Typography Scale**: Consistent heading hierarchy and font sizing system

### Navigation and User Experience

- **Multi-Page Structure**: Traditional website navigation with clear page separation for different content types
- **Mobile Navigation**: Responsive hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Active State Management**: Visual indicators show current page location in navigation

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

- **Font Awesome CDN v6.0**: Provides professional icons and symbols throughout the website interface
- **Google Fonts**: Custom web fonts loaded via CDN for improved typography (referenced in CSS but not fully implemented in provided files)

### Browser Dependencies

- **Modern CSS Features**: Relies on CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Custom Properties support in target browsers
- **Font Awesome**: External CDN dependency for icon rendering

### Hosting Requirements

The static nature of the website makes it compatible with:
- Static hosting services (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- Traditional web hosting with basic HTML/CSS/JS support
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for global distribution
